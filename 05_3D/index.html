  <h3> <b>Week 5 Assignment: 3D Print an object that could not easily made through subtractive methods</b></h3>

<div> Week 5: 3D Design & Printing</div>

</div>
<div> This week, our class learned about the various capabilities of 3D design and printing. We learned how to use PrusaSlicer to convert our 3D models to tangible 3D objects. Our task was to 3D design and print a small object that could potentially be used for our final project. I modeled a bottle cap in Fusion360, along with an adaptor/nozzle that will connect to the bottle cap. I had some issues editing the cap and adaptor the way I wanted to, but I overall just wanted to get a feel for the printer and how I could use it to help prototype my final project. Additionally, we were asked to 3D model the pieces needed for our final project, along with more finalized details on what we need to get it done. My final project seemingly does not need a lot of components (or so I think), so I only modeled two little cap-sized pieces. </div>

</div>

  <h3> My Experience</h3>

</div>
<div> I decided to 3D model and print a prototyped component of my final project. It is essentially a model of a bottle cap with a nozzle out the top of it. I could not find a 3D file on GrabCAD of a bottle cap, so i tried to make my own. I added my own screw threads, attempting to make them identical to that of the standard bottle cap. I did not succeed! The structures of the 3D print were very difficult to get out and my threads did not print correctly. However, I did learn more about how the printer works and have a better idea of how to tackle this bottle cap in the future.</div>

</div>
<div> In addition to creating a 3D modeled component, we were tasked to scan an object using a photogrammetry. I tried to scan a standard coke bottle cap using photogrammetry, however the scanner could not pick up all of the little pieces/threading within the bottle cap. The scan multiple times before I gave up</div>

</div>

<div> For my final project, I plan to make a bottle cap compatible nozzle that tells you how much liquid is being poured out of the bottle in real time. I modeled and printed the top layer/piece of my project, which acts as the exit nozzle/pipe for the liquid. The piece has a hole in the side of it so the electronic display and sensor within the cap can connect to each other. In terms of a sensor, I either will use a motion, tilt, or pressure sensor within the cap. I may also try to work out my own algorithm to "count" how much water leaves the bottle at a time, based on how big the nozzle is, then outputting that info to the user. </div>

</div>

  <h3> Materials Needed</h3>

</div>
<div> Motion/tilt/pressure sensor</div>

</div>
<div> Electronic display</div>

</div>
<div> Wiring sleeve</div>

</div>
<div> Custom bottle cap - more research to come</div>

</div>
<div> Metal piping for nozzle</div>
