  <h3> <b>Week 6 Assignment: Use, code, and interact with sensors</b></h3>

</div>
  <div> Week 6: Electronic Input Devices</div>

</div>
<div> 1) Make a capacitive sensor to measure a physical quantity on your microcontroller</div>

</div>
<div> 2) Configure and use another sensor and include atleast one output device</div>

</div>
<div> 3) Include schematics of both sensors</div>

</div>
<div> 4) Callibrate each sensor by plotting points on a graph and discuss the relationship between the signals recorded and the physical quantities that are being measured</div>

</div>
<div> 5) Prepare CAD files for CNC week</div>

</div>
<h3> My Experience</h3>
</div>
<div> For Electronic Input Week, we were taugh about various types of sensors like capacitance, hall/magnetic, and piezos, among others. I did not finish this week's assignments, however I had a capacitive sensor up and running during the lecture that we learned about them. Continually, I have had more and more experience with sensors throughout the rest of the semester. My final project includes a hall sensor and it was enlightening to learn more about sensor capabilities.
