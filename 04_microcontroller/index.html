  <h3> <b>Week 4 Assignment: Program an Arduino Board to Do Something</b></h3>

</div>
<div> Week 4: Microcontroler Programming</div>

</div>
<div> This week, our class expanded on what we learned last week about kinetic sculptures and how things move. We were introduced to microcontrollers and how to program them with Arduino. The goal of this week's assignment was to program an Arduino Board to do something (make something move, power a motor/switch, etc.). Most students, including myself, opted to continue their work on their kinetic sculpture and power their sculpture with a progranned Arduino board. We were given flexibility to do so from the class instructors, which I am grateful for.</div>

</div>

  <h3> My Experience</h3>

</div>
<div> My kinetic sculpture includes a basketball player with a basketball that dribbes upon each gear rotation. I built a cardboard contraption of a basketball player on a platform, which includes a motor-driven basketball that dribbles. The basketball player is fixed, while the gears drive the basketball up and down. This was a complicated process, as bringing movement from vertical to horizontal back to vertical were pertinent issues. I sanded a few pieces of wood and made drill holes for the motor to connect to the gears, then programmed the microcontroller to continuously dribble the basketball. The goal of this week 4 assignment was to program the arduino board to make an action, which I did through my kinetic sculpture. </div>
