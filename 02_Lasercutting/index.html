  <h3> Week 2 Assignment: Laser Cutting</h3>

</div>
<div> Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting</div>

</div>
<div> This week, our class learned about CAD programming (Computer Aided Design) and how to create a tangible object through CAD, with the help of a laser cutter. We also learned how to use a vinyl cutter and how to use programs like Inkscape, Fusion360, and Rhino to model a design. The goal of this week's assignment was to create press-fit construction kit, out of a material like cardboard, that can be assembled in multiple ways and that fits together snuggly when assembled with only notches in the material. The construction kit is first modeled on Fusion360 to create a 2D and 3D digital representation of the pieces that we want to make. This included making a 2D shape, finding a proper notch width/length, extruding the shape from 2D to 3D, calculating the thickness and kerf of the cardboard, adding/changing parameters, and exporting it into its proper DXF file. Once the desired shapes needed to make a kit are modeled, they are sent to the laser cutter to turn our digital model into a tangible prototype.</div>

</div>

  <h3> My Experience</h3>

</div>
<div> This is my first time using CAD programming or any machine even close to the same category as a laser cutter. This assignment is unlike anythink I've ever done and I found it very fun, engaging, and challenging. Stemming from the prompt of using notches to piece together a structure, my mind eventually drifted toward the construction of the classic log cabin. After watching Fusion360 tutorials and failing to create even a basic shape a few times, I eventually got the hang of the platform and started doing the math needed to model my future log cabin prototype. I wanted the log cabin to be a rectangle with at least 3 panels per wall, so I landed on 6 pieces being 25mm x 75mm (3 and 3), and another 6 pieces being 25mm x 100mm (3 and 3). These two piece designs serve as the base of my cabin, while two other pieces serve different parts of the cabin: the roof, and a connector for the walls/roof.</div>

</div>
<div> Now that I had my pieces decided on, it was time to do more math to ensure the pieces fit together snuggly. The cardboard I landed on measured to be 4.3mm thick, and after a few tests I decided that the kerf I was getting from the laser cutter was 0.7mm. Given my parameters, my notches were measured at 3.6mm on Fusion360. Once I had all the parameters correct, I sent my files to the laser cutter and proceeded to assemble my log cabin, which fit together pretty nicely.</div>

</div>

  <h3> Step By Step</h3>

</div>
<div> To begin, I made a new file in Fusion360 and started a sketch on the "top" plain. I used a 2-point rectangle with the beginnning point being on the middle of the canvas. I manually input my width (25mm) before pressing Tab to manually input my length (100mm). Then I selected the shape and offset the border line by 7mm to create an inner rectangle that would serve as the inner border for my eventual notches. Next, I created construction lines using the sketch palette to show myself where I wanted my notches on the shape to be. I offset my vertical construction lines by 1.8mm and mirrored them to create 3.6mm notches in my rectangle. I then used non-construction lines to outline my shape, just to be sure the correct object was selected. After this I pressed E to pick which sections of the shape should be extruded to 3D and clarify which sections should not be included in the final shape. I prompted my extrude function to make my new 3D rendering 4.3mm thick, the same thickness as the cardboard, then pressed OK. To make the notches fit more smoothly and avoid accidents during log cabin construction, I pressed F to add fillets to the corners of the notches in my shape at 3mm. To finish the process, I pressed P, picked the top plane of my shape, selected the top plane of my shape, then pressed OK. This created a new sketch of a 2D rendering of my shape that is compatible with the laser cutter. I saved my file as a DXF, stored it in a flash drive, then printed them from the flash drive to the laser cutter. I did this for all 4 of my pieces.</div>

</div>

  <h3> Trials and Tribulations</h3>

</div>
<div> This was by no means a smooth process and I definitely did not get it right on my first try. Initially, I had my material thickness at 4.4mm, my kerf at 0.4mm, and my notch thickness at 4mm. I also had my notches initially at 9mm deep. I printed out two walls and they fit together very loosely and the nothces were too deep. I then measured the notches that the laser cutter produced, finding it to be 4.7mm wide (when my CAD model had it listed as 4.0mm). In knowing these defficiences I did math to make it work. Since my shape was 25mm tall, a 9mm notch was too big for the pieces to fit snug. I randomly chose 7 to do math with, finding that 7mm on each side of the rectangle left 11mm for the middle of the shape, which was the perfect amount of space for the notches to fit snuggly (math wise). I then re-measured my cardboard, finding it to be 4.3mm thick, rather than 4.4mm. I input my new parameters (4.3mm thick, 0.7mm kerf, 3.6mm wide notches, 7mm deep notches) and made new DXF files. After another test trial, the pieces fit pretty perfectly so I went full-go on production. I wish I added a door but I am very pleased with what I have produced.</div>
