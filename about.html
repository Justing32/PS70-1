### About Me: Justin Glod

  <p> Hello everybody, My name is Justin Glod and I am a super senior living in Winthrop. I am a psychology concentrator with hopes of finishing up a computer science secondary. I have lived in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan my whole life with two brothers, a sister, and two awesome parents. Outside of school, I enjoy making art, watching sports, journaling, and hanging out with friends. A fun fact about me is that I am a dual citizen, with citizenship in the United States and the Republic of San Marino in Italy. I am extremely excited to be taking this class and getting to know all of you better!</p>

Here is an image of me:
