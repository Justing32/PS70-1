  <h3> <b>Week 3 Assignment: Creating a Kinetic Sculpture</b></h3>

</div>
<div> Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</div>

</div>
<div> This week, our class learned how to use an assortment of tools like saws, drills, nuts/bolts/screws and different types of glue. Additionally, we learned how to solder and the basics of electrical currents and motors. The goal of this week's assignment was to create a kinetic sculpture that's controlled by an electric circuit. We also had to use a multimeter to measure the voltage in our sculptures and use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit. The structure can be made in many different ways and I love the creative freedom we have with this assignment.</div>

</div>

  <h3> My Experience</h3>

</div>
<div> After analyzing past projects, I gained inspiration from Sophie's flock of birds. I initally wanted to have a kinetic sculpture of a golfer swinging a putter back and forth, however there were too many hinges to deal with the more I drew it out. I wanted to create a simple kinetic motion that incorporated gears and was related to sports, so I opted to create a kinetic sculpture of a basketball player dribbling a basketball. To do this, I created a wire axis of alternating heights that attached to gears, which are powered by a motor. Connected to the wire axis is a perpendicular wire that moves a basketball up and down as the gears turn. The perpendicular wire was fastened only through coiling, which was challenging. Aside from the wiring element, I created a structure to house my basketball player. I modeled my structure and gears in Fusion 360, which has been getting more and more comfortable to use.</div>

</div>
<div> The structure I created includes two walls, a floor, and a ceiling. One wall has a hole for the motor to connect to the gears and the ceiling has a hole for the basketball to go up and down through it. The floor and the second wall are fasteners for the structure, while the basketball player stands atop the ceiling. This structure is mostly press-fit like last week's assignment, something I find very satisfying. I had to calculate the dimensions of my gears and structure proportionally so that everything would fit neatly. I measured the dimensions of the motor leg with a caliper so that it would fit snuggly into my first gear. The wire I used is coiled around a wooden rectangular block that I connected to my second gear. Additionally, I had to code my motor to continously spin at a certain rate when the program is running. In order to connect the motor to the kinetic sculpture, I had to make a contraption that properly connected the two, which I did through shaving down various pieces of wood. The sculpture did not work out the way I wanted, however the gears did work and I learned how to control a motor through an arduino breadboard.</div>
</div>

</div>
<div> I attempted to finish this kinetic sculpture at home, however I unfortunately got denied from every school and makerspace I inquired about using a laser cutter. I still put the sculpture together with hot glue and got my gears rotating. The motor would be connected to the wooden stake protruding from the sculputure, spinning the axis and the basketball up and down. This assignment would have been great if I put more time into it, however this is what our final product is for this week's assignment.</div>
