  <h3> Week 1 Assignment: Final Project Proposal</h3>

</div>
<div> Liquid Measurement Nozzle (Top Idea)</div>

</div>

<body> This contraption would eliminate the use for measuring cups when measuring liquids. The nozzle would replace the bottle cap of a milk container (for example) and have an electrical component, similar to a gas pump, to inform the user how much liquid they are pouring at a time. This would help make cooking more efficient and include 3D design, electronics, and programming.</body>

</div>
<div> Joint Mobility Measuring Device</div>

</div>

<body> This device would use a motion detecting camera to detect differences in joint mobility on both sides of the body (right/left). Physical therapists use protractors and a pen/paper to measure joint mobility in patients (mainly ankle measurements). It is difficult to rotate your ankle as far as possible and hold it in that position until the doctor takes the measurement (especially if you are coming off of an injury). This device would see how far a patient's joint mobility ranges frame-by-frame, allowing doctors to conclude what is giving their patients pain more efficiently, while also avoiding patient strain.</body>

</div>
<div> Randomly Timed Music Stereo for Patients with Alzheimer's</div>

</div>

<body> This device would randomly play music in the homes of patients with Alzheimer's (during the daytime) to help refresh cognitive functions associated with short and long-term memory. Music has been shown to improve the severity of Alzheimer's symptoms if listened to regularly, helping patients create more sensory associations with their surroundings and actions. There are a lot of caveats to this idea, however a version of this could be useful in homes.</body>
